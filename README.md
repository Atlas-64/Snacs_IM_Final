# Snacs Final Project

*INFLUENCE MAXIMIZATION USING HEURISTIC ALGORITHMS*

Contains the consolidated code, documentation, and other relevant files for the final research project in SNACS 2026.

For the ICM python code, the numpy, networkx and hashlib  packages will be required. In the  first cell you can find the importing process for the dataset, change to the one required according the testing goals.

In cell 8 and 9 there can be found the process for getting the seed sets and doing the simulations iteratively. Modify the parameters accordingly to run tests, we recommend reducing the p probability, seed range or permutation number
if the objective  is doing short tests, as some of runs that were done for the project took over 12 hours.
